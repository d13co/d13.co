Second Wave: March 5, 2023\
Third Wave: March 6, 2023\

This article presents data from the fifth wave - March 31 - as well as
subsequent movements of stolen funds.

Summary
-------

The attack was automated and ran for 14 hours - from 2023-03-31 10:15
(GMT) until 2023-04-01 00:25 (GMT). ASAs were drained from 4,166
accounts into the following malicious account:

MVEKYHFLJ63UKDYGNKCJD7WO5KFJZFVFMJPSDAWLDIDP4LUP575YDOW6GI

At least 184 of these addresses have been targeted in previous waves.

69 different ASAs were stolen. Aside from the initial seeding of the
malicious address by a known-compromised address, ALGO was not targetted
in this attack.

The total value stolen is approx. \$160K USD, per [ASA
stats](https://www.asastats.com/MVEKYHFLJ63UKDYGNKCJD7WO5KFJZFVFMJPSDAWLDIDP4LUP575YDOW6GI)
(note: some tokens were not recognized).
