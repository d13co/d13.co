We are focusing on the following three types of transactions to begin with:\nDEX swaps Liquidations ASA/NFT mints What kind of DEX swaps will you support? In short: most of them.\nOur backend is much further ahead than our frontend. We have “processors” that parse Tinyman, AlgoFi and PactFi swaps very reliably.\nWe are currently focusing on the top 30-50 most popular pools on each DEX, so not all pools will be shown in the first incarnation of our frontend.\nWe will be working on HumbleSwap and AlgoDex processors shortly after our Alpha version is released. HDX support is also on our roadmap.\nWhat kind of Liquidation events will you support? Currently we have a processor for AlgoFi that we used to write up this report.\nWe will be supporting Folks Finance liquidations after the Alpha release, and xBacked liquidations shortly after that.\nWhat kind of ASA/NFT mints will you support? In short: all of them.\nWe have a processor that works reliably with both simple ASA creation transactions and inner-transactions that happen when an ASA or NFT is minted using a smart contract.\nAn exmaple of smart-contract minted NFTs are NFDomains - we will likely provide a dedicated view of NFDomain mints.\nWe are doing this for two reasons:\nWe think it may be a useful way to discover new NFT content and that it has entertainment value. There is something fascinating about watching NFTs seconds after they have been minted. We want to provide a fraud notification services for NFT creators that are large enough to worry about such concerns. As the Algorand NFT space grows, fraudulent NFT mints that infringe on creator copyright and defraud users by selling them infringing NFTs will likely become more prevalent. If there is demand for this, we intend to build a discord integration that provides a bot on customer servers and notifies when an infringing NFT has been minted, so that their community can take action as soon as the infringing NFT has hit the chain.\nWhat timeframes will you support? We aim to provide data from block 17,700,000 (Sun, 28 Nov 2021 10:23:12 GMT) until “now”.\nIf there is need for earlier data, we will be able to accomodate.\nHow is this going to be profitable? We hope to prove our competence in building an extremely reliable blockchain event responding service, and subsequently offer our data and services to creators and developers.\nFurther to the above example of fraudulent NFT detection, we believe we can reliably offer the following:\nDEX token pair price points real-time historical time aggregates (daily/weekly/monthly) platform-specific or chain-wide DEX liquidity events Arbitrage opportunities Liquidation Events Liquidation Opportunities We want to build delivery channels that work for our customers, so any of the following are possible:\nHTTP APIs Server-Sent Events (our favorite streaming option) Websocket APIs Webhooks Push notification services like Pushbullet Email Twitter bots Discord bots Building this system with very high availability is our number one priority. We will be using Algorand Observer data to build both internal tools and consumer products.\nIs this an official Algorand inc or Algorand Foundation project? No.\nWho is funding this? The same people who are developing it - the D13.co//ective.\nWe are not currently looking for funding.\nWe will not be asking for money until we have something of value to offer in return.\nWhere can I be updated about your progress? You can follow us on twitter: @Algo_Observer and @D13_co.\n","wordCount":"628","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-06-25T02:18:38+03:00","dateModified":"2022-06-25T02:18:38+03:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"D13.co//ective"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://blog.algorand.observer/posts/what-is-algorand-observer/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Algorand Observer","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://blog.algorand.observer/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://blog.algorand.observer/ accesskey=h title="  (Alt + H)"><img src=https://blog.algorand.observer/images/logo4-white-48.png alt=logo aria-label=logo height=48></a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://D13.co//ective title="By the D13.co//ective"><span>By the D13.co//ective</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://blog.algorand.observer/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://blog.algorand.observer/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>What is Algorand Observer?</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-06-25 02:18:38 +0300 EEST'>June 25, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;3 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;628 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;D13.co//ective&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/d13co/blog.algorand.observer/tree/main/content/posts/what-is-algorand-observer.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><h2 id=tldr-real-time-blockchain-event-streaming>TL;DR: Real-time blockchain event streaming.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#tldr-real-time-blockchain-event-streaming>#</a></h2><p>We are building a set of services around parsing and reacting to specific blockchain events on the Algorand MainNet network.</p><p>The public frontend to this will be Algorand.Observer, where users will be able to see this data, as well as aggregates & statistics, in real-time.</p><h2 id=what-kind-of-on-chain-events>What kind of on-chain events?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#what-kind-of-on-chain-events>#</a></h2><p>We are focusing on the following three types of transactions to begin with:</p><ul><li>DEX swaps</li><li>Liquidations</li><li>ASA/NFT mints</li></ul><h2 id=what-kind-of-dex-swaps-will-you-support>What kind of DEX swaps will you support?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#what-kind-of-dex-swaps-will-you-support>#</a></h2><p>In short: most of them.</p><p>Our backend is much further ahead than our frontend.
