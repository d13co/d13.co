Most cloud providers do not accept conscience bucks, so we will do what we can with free offerings.\nThe Oracle Cloud has an \"always free\" tier which includes good-enough virtual servers for our purposes. Traditionally this is where I state my affiliations and paid promotions, but there are none in this case. I am a happy Oracle free tier user and that's it. No money has exchanged hands for the production of this article. There is one minor gotcha which I will treat as a cliff-hanger for now.\n⚠️\r2023 update: There was also one major gotcha: Oracle can reclaim your free instances at any time and without notice. After this happened to our nodes, we no longer recommend Oracle Cloud as a solution. For anything.\rIf you are going to host your participation node elsewhere, skip to step 5.\nStep 1: Set up an account on Oracle Cloud Go here and click \"Start for free\" if the following disclaimer does not dissuade you:\n⚠️\r2023 update: This hosting option is no longer recommended. Your instance can be revoked at any time, including all hard disk images, leading you with no restoration options, i.e. data loss.\rIt will ask for billing details, but it won't charge you unless you explicitly upgrade to a paid account.\nIt will ask you for a region - there are no wrong answers there. A region near where you are geographically may be marginally beneficial to you.\nGo do that and come back to set up your first server.\nStep 2: Create SSH keys We will be accessing our brand new virtual server using SSH. As such we can prepare the SSH keys we will use up front. If you already have SSH keys that you can use, we still recommend creating new ones for this, but we ain't your boss.\nThis process is meant for your own computer/laptop. It will generate an SSH key on most *nix computers. For Windows with WSL, this should work. For Putty specific pointers, see the end of this section.\ncd ~/.ssh 2\u003e /dev/null || mkdir ~/.ssh \u0026\u0026 cd ~/.ssh ssh-keygen -t ed25519 The first line creates a \"hidden\" directory called .ssh under your home directory (if that doesn't exist). The second starts the interactive SSH key generation wizard, asking it to create an ED25519 key (which Algorand uses for accounts, so you know it's good)\nThe flow will be like this:\n$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 # Generating public/private ed25519 key pair. # Enter file in which to save the key (/home/bit/.ssh/id_ed25519): type id_oracle and press enter. it will then ask you for a passphrase. It is highly recommended to use one. Enter your passphrase and press enter.\n$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 # Generating public/private ed25519 key pair. # Enter file in which to save the key (/home/bit/.ssh/id_ed25519): id_oracle # Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): and then once again:\nEnter same passphrase again: And you're done! You will be rewarded with some sweet ASCII art (great NFT idea) and the newly created keys will be in the .ssh/ directory under your Home directory.\nLet's check that they are there before proceeding:\nls ~/.ssh/ # id_oracle id_oracle.pub Perfect. The private key is id_oracle and the public key is id_oracle.pub\nDo not send the private key (`id_oracle`) to anyone. You can send the .pub freely - we will be uploading it to Oracle Cloud soon!\n🪟 Using Putty on Windows? We can't provide extra-detailed instructions on these but the high level bullet points are:\nYou will need to generate keys with PuttyGen. We recommend a Ed25519 key-pair. We recommend protecting it with a pass-phrase. If needed, PuttyGen key generation documentation can be found here. Kudos to @prunka for testing this guide on a Windows/Putty environment.\nStep 3: Provision a good-enough Ampere Server ⚠️ Using Brave Browser or Ad-blockers? The Oracle Cloud site may not work with ad-blocking enabled. If you run into errors during the creation of instances, you can disable ad-block and try again.\nKudos to @prunka for figuring out this issue.\nWe need to get to the Compute ➡ Instances section of the Oracle Cloud platform. Log in, then try to navigate to this link:\n☢️\r2023 update: This hosting option is no longer recommended. Your instance can be revoked at any time, including all hard disk images, leading you with no restoration options, i.e. data loss.\rhttps://cloud.oracle.com/compute/instances\nIn case the URL structures have changed by the time you embark on your quest, this can be found on the left-hand-side menu:\nClick the Ξ menu Compute -\u003e Instances You should see a \"Create Instance\" button. Click it\nYou can name your instance whatever you like, like consensio-participatore. It doesn't matter very much.\nClick \"Edit\" on the \"Image and shape\" panel\n⚠️\r2023 update: Oracle cloud is no longer recommended. Your instance can be revoked at any time, including all hard disk images, leading you with no restoration options, i.e. data loss. This guide is still up for historical purposes.\rThen \"Change Image\"\nTick the \"Canonical Ubuntu\" row and click \"Select Image\". 22.04 should be fine.\nThen we are going to change shape as well. Click the \"Change Shape\" button:\nWe want a Virtual Machine/Ampere server:\nYou get a budget of 4 (o)CPUs and 24GB of RAM to distribute as you see fit in up to 4 instances. A good start would be to use half your budget in each, so let's pick 2 oCPUs and 12GB of RAM, and click \"Select shape\".\nYour \"Image and Shape\" panel should look like this:\nNearly done! Scroll down to \"Add SSH Keys\" and select \"Upload public key files (.pub)\"\n⚠️\r2023 update: Oracle cloud is no longer recommended. Your instance can be revoked at any time, including all hard disk images, leading you with no restoration options, i.e. data loss. This guide is still up for historical purposes.\rThen click Browse and navigate to $HOME/.ssh/ and select id_oracle.pub\n(Your File Explorer should be able to either show hidden files, or navigate to that directory directly. You can also try to navigate to ~/ssh/ - ~ meaning \"Home\" in most places.)\nNow click \"Create\" and wait a bit for your server to boot!\nIt is possible that Oracle cloud is temporarily out of available resources to spin up your desired server in that “availability domain”.\nTo fix this, scroll to the top and hit “Edit” in the “Placement” panel and select a different Availability Domain.\n⚠️ “Out of capacity for this shape” or similar errors? It is possible that Oracle cloud is temporarily out of available resources to spin up your desired server in that \"availability domain\".\nTo fix this, scroll to the top and hit \"Edit\" in the \"Placement\" panel and select a different Availability Domain.\nStep 4: Connect with SSH You should be redirected to your Instance page, where it will be in an orange \"PROVISIONING\" state for a while. Wait until it transitions to a \"RUNNING\" state and copy the \"Public IP address\" using the link in the right column of the (default) \"Instance Information\" panel\nYou should now be able to connect to your server! Copy this, replace 40.40.40.40 with your actual server IP from above and run it on your terminal:\nssh -i ~/.ssh/id_oracle ubuntu@40.40.40.40 🪟 Using Putty on Windows? Make sure you have a recent version of Putty - ideally v0.75 or newer.\nOlder Putty versions may not be compatible with modern SSH key requirements, such as the default ones on Ubuntu 22.04.\nOracle has documentation about SSH from Putty but make sure to use the username ubuntu instead of oracle.\nℹ️ Pro Tip: ping is blocked by default If you are trying to troubleshoot connectivity issues, do not rely on good ole “ping” - you won't get a “pong” by default.\nping-type ICMP packets are blocked in the default security group (\"firewall\") on Oracle cloud. A guide to fix this can be found here.\nYou should see a bunch of information including:\nWelcome to Ubuntu 22.04.X LTS (GNU/Linux 5.1X.0-1016-oracle aarch64) ... ubuntu@consensio-participatore:~$ Test that you have administrative privileges, as you'll need them shortly:\nsudo echo I am admin The computer must parrot I am admin back at you.\nFor good measure, let's update the system:\nsudo apt-get update \u0026\u0026 sudo apt-get dist-upgrade -y It may take a while.\nStep 5: Install algod algod is the Algorand daemon, which is used for algorand nodes of all flavors.\nWe will be installing it with the updater script method from the Algorand Developer Portal documentation. The easier Package Manager route is not available to the architecture of the Ampere servers (AARCH64)\nLFG, run these:\nmkdir ~/node cd ~/node curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/algorand/go-algorand/rel/stable/cmd/updater/update.sh -O chmod 744 update.sh ./update.sh -i -c stable -p ~/node -d ~/node/data -n You should see:\nubuntu@consensio-participatore:~$ mkdir ~/node ubuntu@consensio-participatore:~$ cd ~/node ubuntu@consensio-participatore:~/node$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/algorand/go-algorand/rel/stable/cmd/updater/update.sh -O % Total % Received % Xferd Average Speed Time Time Time Current Dload Upload Total Spent Left Speed 100 24197 100 24197 0 0 116k 0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 116k ubuntu@consensio-participatore:~/node$ chmod 744 update.sh ubuntu@consensio-participatore:~/node$ ./update.sh -i -c stable -p ~/node -d ~/node/data -n Current Version = 0 Downloading https://algorand-releases.s3.amazonaws.com/channel/stable/install_stable_linux-arm64_3.8.0.tar.gz Downloaded into file /tmp/tmp.DqPy3xV3qq/install_stable_linux-arm64_3.8.0.tar.gz updater binary was installed at /home/ubuntu/node/updater Latest Version = 12885557248 New version found Checking for files matching: 'channel/stable/node_stable_linux-arm64_' in bucket algorand-releases Update Downloaded to /tmp/tmp.qC2pbxUIB9/12885557248.tar.gz Expanding update...

Deleting existing log files in /home/ubuntu/node/data Install complete - restart node manually So good.\nStep 6: Tell Ubuntu its purpose is algod now Run:\ncd ~/node sudo ./systemd-setup.sh ubuntu ubuntu /home/ubuntu/node You should see: [SUCCESS] systemd system service has been installed.\nGreat! Now we can set algod to run on system boot, in case our server ever reboots, expectedly or not:\nsudo systemctl enable algorand@-home-ubuntu-node-data You will see a friendly response like this: Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/algorand@-home-ubuntu-node.service → /lib/systemd/system/algorand@.service.\nFinally we need to help ourselves and goal (the command line algod client) by performing these incantations:\necho 'export PATH=$PATH:/home/ubuntu/node' \u003e\u003e ~/.bashrc echo 'export ALGORAND_DATA=/home/ubuntu/node/data' \u003e\u003e ~/.bashrc These allow 1) your shell (terminal) to find and execute goal and b) goal to find the correct Algorand data directory.\nNormally we would need to log out and back in again for those to work but we can skip this step by running:\nsource ~/.bashrc We should now be able to start algod! Run:\ngoal node start It should respond with Algorand node successfully started!\nIf it doesn't, try logging out of the server and back in again and resuming from goal node start\nLet's see how algod is doing. Run:\ngoal node status You should be treated to a status report like this:\nLast committed block: 3351 Time since last block: 0.2s Sync Time: 48.7s Last consensus protocol: https://github.com/algorandfoundation/specs/tree/5615adc36bad610c7f165fa2967f4ecfa75125f0 Next consensus protocol: https://github.com/algorandfoundation/specs/tree/5615adc36bad610c7f165fa2967f4ecfa75125f0 Round for next consensus protocol: 3352 Next consensus protocol supported: true Last Catchpoint: Genesis ID: mainnet-v1.0 Genesis hash: wGHE2Pwdvd7S12BL5FaOP20EGYesN73ktiC1qzkkit8= It has already caught up more than three thousand blocks! Only 24 million to go at the time of writing.\nStep 7: Fast Ketchup We don't actually need all of those blocks, so we can skip ahead with the algod catchup service.\nGo to the official documentation page for this and click the link next to \"MainNet\". It may look like this:\nMainNet https://algorand-catchpoints.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/channel/mainnet/latest.catchpoint On that page you will see a friendly string like this:\n24050000#OF5FIXZEEFXIFXHRP72U5EBUPTSPCEGUZ3QJRK2P77XAE6UIMVQA copy that, surround it with single quotes and run this command:\ngoal node catchup '24050000#OF5FIXZEEFXIFXHRP72U5EBUPTSPCEGUZ3QJRK2P77XAE6UIMVQA' (single quotes around the 24050..MVQA line are important)\nOK, we should now be zipping ahead in blockchain history. This command starts from a catchpoint/checkpoint at a recent block number (24050000 at our example). It will validate the data it receives, so it will still take some time, but it should still be a lot quicker than not using it.\nYou can leave goal node status -w 5000 running, which will show you the status of algod every 5 seconds.

start) We made a simple script to calculate these values which you can see here\nAll it does is generate the goal account addpartkey command with reasonable parameters for your address. Otherwise refer to the Algorand dev docs and create the values yourself.\nIf you want to use, it you can download it with:\nwget https://gist.githubusercontent.com/d13co/edca626cedc62240b41becffcc0dd18d/raw/9e777accb9d40c067634c055acd000caa4aa58a0/gen.sh You run it by passing the address you will participate with and the duration in rounds (or nothing for the default 650,000 round duration).\nℹ️ Using AlgoFi vault? If you are using the AlgoFi vault to participate, you need to use your AlgoFi vault address in these steps.\nFind your vault address in the Vault page -\u003e Govern Tab -\u003e \"Vault Address: 234..567 \" and copy it with the copy icon\nSo get your participation address and run it like this example that uses our DTHIRTEENN..YARNQE address:\nbash gen.sh DTHIRTEENNLSYGLSEXTXC6X4SVDWMFRCPAOAUCXWIXJRCVBWIIGLYARNQE and it will spit back\nCurrent round: 24056924 Start round: 24057090 (+100) End round: 24707090 (+650000) Dilution (sqrt(end-start)): 806 Command to run: goal account addpartkey -a DTHIRTEENNLSYGLSEXTXC6X4SVDWMFRCPAOAUCXWIXJRCVBWIIGLYARNQE --roundFirstValid=24057090 --roundLastValid=24707090 --keyDilution=806 You can copy-paste the entire goal account addpartkey line into your shell:\ngoal account addpartkey -a DTHIRTEENNLSYGLSEXTXC6X4SVDWMFRCPAOAUCXWIXJRCVBWIIGLYARNQE --roundFirstValid=24057090 --roundLastValid=24707090 --keyDilution=806 # Please stand by while generating keys. This might take a few minutes... It ain't lying, it will take a good few minutes to generate the keys.\nIn the meantime let's talk about the selected 650,000 participation duration value and The Oracle Always Free Tier Gotcher.\nThe Oracle Always Free Tier has, so far, lived up to the Always and Free aspects - except for a hoop you have to jump through:\n❗\rAs it happens, “always” in Oracle’s case means “Until we delete your servers and data without warning.”.\rWhen your trial period expires (in about a month from your registration) they heartlessly terminate your instances - and not only that, but you can't simple turn them back on - though the workaround is almost as simple as that: you terminate the old instance while keeping the disk, and recreate a similar instance with that boot disk, so all your data is there. See Appendix A for detailed instructions.\nAs such we advise creating a participation key that will automatically in ~29 days. Being marked \"participating\" and not actually participating is arguably worse than not doing anything at all - when your time comes to propose a block or vote, nothing will happen, and the network will be delayed.\nSo after the goal account addpartkey command is done, we can check if the keys were generated correctly. We do this with the following command:\ngoal account listpartkeys which should return a key for your account (disregard actual details, illustrative example from Algorand Developer Portal site)\nRegistered Account ParticipationID Last Used First round Last round yes TUQ4...NLQQ GOWHR456... 27 0 3000000 Step 10: Let's go online like it's 1999 The final step (yes, really!) is to declare to the network that your address authorized those participation keys to participate in consensus on your behalf.\nWe will cover a couple of different options here in the future but for now we will provide instructions for the AlgoFi vault.\nℹ️ Not using AlgoFi vault? If you are participating with your own address, let us know that you want this section of the guide written ASAP and in the meantime you have to make do with the Algorand Developer Portal documentation on registering online.\nThere is a tool to “go online”/“offline” without needing to put your seed phrase on your server here\nAssuming you have some balance vaulted there, click the discrete \"three humans\" icon tool-tipped \"Consensus Participation Status\":\nThis will open a modal like this:\nYou can find all this information on your server if you issue the command\ngoal account partkeyinfo It will respond with information like this:\nParticipation ID: RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRA Parent address: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA Last vote round: 22222222 Last block proposal round: 22222222 Effective first round: 22222222 Effective last round: 22222222 First round: 22222222 Last round: 22222222 Key dilution: 2828 Selection key: RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR= Voting key: KKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK= State proof key: SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS= Fill in the AlgoFi vault form with this information. Click the Send Key Reg Transaction, and sign it in your wallet.\n⚠️ Error: (...) first voting round beyond the next voting round If you get an error like this:\n\"transaction tries to mark an account as online with first voting round beyond the next voting round\"\nthen you need to wait until Algorand MainNet passes your \"vote first round\" parameter\nYou could use AlgoExplorer but as a NODE OPERATOR(!) you can run:\ngoal node status -w 1000\nAnd that will display the current node status, which includes \"Last committed block\", refreshing every second. Wait for your \"vote first round\" to pass, and hit Ctrl+C to exit. If it all goes well, the modal will list your account as Online:\nStep 11: Monitoring it Remember those tail|grep commands that we learned a bit ago? Those will come in handy about now. Let's follow the algod logs and see if your address is listed in there. Replace YOUR_ADDRESS with your... yep - participation address and run this:\ncd ~/node/data tail -n 1000 -f node.log | grep YOUR_ADDRESS Eventually you will see lines like this:\n{\"Context\":\"Agreement\",\"Hash\":\"MM\",\"ObjectPeriod\":0,\"ObjectRound\":24057605,\"ObjectStep\":2,\"Period\":0,\"Round\":0,\"Sender\":\"YOUR_ADDRESS\",\"Step\":0,\"Type\":\"VoteBroadcast\",\"Weight\":1,\"WeightTotal\":1,\"file\":\"pseudonode.go\",\"function\":\"github.com/algorand/go-algorand/agreement.pseudonodeVotesTask.execute\",\"level\":\"info\",\"line\":427,\"msg\":\"vote created for broadcast (weight 1, total weight 1)\",\"time\":\"2022-10-11T17:46:46.209127Z\"} Note the \"Type\":\"VoteBroadcast\": our address just voted to verify a block!\nIf there are any errors with consensus you will see them this way.\nYou can exit this command with Ctrl+C.\n⚠️ Error: Account was closed but still has a participation key active In our case we initially got an error about Account was closed but still has a participation key active. but it went away by itself 🤷\nIf you get this, go have lunch and come back in an hour to see if it hasn't resolved itself, otherwise open a forum issue or otherwise seek assistance.\nFor a more high-level view of how your node is doing, try this command:\ngoal account partkeyinfo Among other things, this will tell you the last round that you voted or proposed a block:\nLast vote round: 24057000 Last block proposal round: 24056001 Missing: Auto-update instructions This section will eventually include instructions to automatically update (and restart) algod\n// TODO Step 12: One month later: The Regeneration You can now rest for a month! After you set up your instance permanently (see Appendix A) you can generate the participation keys again from step 9 but use a larger participation duration range, e.g.\nbash gen.sh ADDRESS 3000000 3 mllion blocks should be about 128 days at 3.7s round times.\nIf you followed this all the way to here, seriously, thank you.\nIf you have any feedback on this guide or how funny the single meme was, please shoot it at bit {@} d13 [.] co via the electronic post office or on our post on the /r/D13 subreddt or on Twitter at @d13_co (and give us a follow.)\nAppendix A: Resurrecting terminated Oracle Cloud Instance At the end of your trial period, Oracle will shamelessly terminate your instance and not even allow you to \"resume\" it.\n⚠️\r2023 update: Oracle cloud is no longer recommended. Your instance can be revoked at any time, including all hard disk images, leading you with no restoration options, i.e. data loss. This guide is still up for historical purposes.\rLuckily the workaround is very quick, or we wouldn't be using or advertising this platform at all.\nNote the availability domain of your instance In your instance page you will see \"Availability domain: XX-Y\"\nMake a note of that.\nDelete the instance, keep the boot volume Find your instance that will no longer start and terminate it MAKING SURE THE \"Permanently delete the attached boot volume\" IS NOT CHECKED\nOK, now we basically just recreate it with the same boot disk and we're good. All that will change is the IP we access it at. Not great, but good enough for free. 🤷\nCreate the instance with that boot volume We follow the instructions from the top with a twist: Rather than set up the whole thing again, we set the Availability Domain of the new instance to match the just-terminated one, and we set the Image to use the previous Boot Volume.\nSo on to \"Create Instance\": https://cloud.oracle.com/compute/instances/create\n1) Hit \"Edit\" in the Placement panel and select the Availability Domain to the one you noted earlier (if needed)\n2) Image And Shape -\u003e Edit -\u003e Change image\n3) In the \"Image Source\" dropdown, select \"Boot volumes\"\nYour list should show your existing boot volume.\nSelect it, click \"Select Image\"\n4) Select your desired \"Shape\" features as before - Ampere, 2x oCPUs, 12GB RAM\n5) Click Create and see your instance spin up\nNote: The server instance's public IP will change.

</code></pre><p>It ain't lying, it will take a good few minutes to generate the keys.</p><p>In the meantime let's talk about the selected 650,000 participation
duration value and The Oracle Always Free Tier Gotcher.</p><hr><p>The Oracle <del>Always</del> Free Tier has, so far, lived up to the <del>Always</del> and Free
aspects - except for a hoop you have to jump through:</p><style>#callout{background:rgba(127,127,127,.2);padding:1.5em 1.25em;border-radius:3px;display:flex;flex-direction:row;margin-bottom:20px}#callout-inner{margin-left:1em}@media(max-width:767px){#callout{padding:1.5em .75em 1.5em .6em}#callout-inner{margin-left:.5em}}</style><div id=callout><div>❗</div><div id=callout-inner>As it happens, &ldquo;always&rdquo; in Oracle&rsquo;s case means &ldquo;Until we delete your servers and data without warning.&rdquo;.</div></div><p>When your trial period expires (in about a month from your registration)
they heartlessly <strong>terminate your instances -</strong> and not only that, but
you can't simple turn them back on - though the workaround is almost as
simple as that: you terminate the old instance while keeping the disk,
and recreate a similar instance with that boot disk, so all your data is
there. See Appendix A for detailed instructions.</p><p>As such we advise creating a participation key that will automatically
in ~29 days.  Being marked "participating" and not actually
participating is arguably worse than not doing anything at all - when
your time comes to propose a block or vote, nothing will happen, and the
network will be delayed.</p><hr><p>So after the <code>goal account addpartkey</code> command is done, we can check if
the keys were generated correctly. We do this with the following
command:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>goal account listpartkeys
</code></pre><p>which should return a key for your account (disregard actual details,
illustrative example from Algorand Developer Portal site)</p><pre tabindex=0><code>Registered  Account      ParticipationID   Last Used  First round  Last round

instance and not even allow you to "resume" it.</p><style>#callout{background:rgba(127,127,127,.2);padding:1.5em 1.25em;border-radius:3px;display:flex;flex-direction:row;margin-bottom:20px}#callout-inner{margin-left:1em}@media(max-width:767px){#callout{padding:1.5em .75em 1.5em .6em}#callout-inner{margin-left:.5em}}</style><div id=callout><div>⚠️</div><div id=callout-inner>2023 update: Oracle cloud is no longer recommended. Your instance can be revoked at any time, including all hard disk images, leading you with no restoration options, i.e. data loss. This guide is still up for historical purposes.</div></div><p>Luckily the workaround is very quick, or we wouldn't be using or
advertising this platform at all.</p><h3 id=note-the-availability-domain-of-your-instance>Note the availability domain of your instance<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#note-the-availability-domain-of-your-instance>#</a></h3><p>In your instance page you will see "Availability domain: XX-Y"</p><p><img loading=lazy src=1665508417.png alt></p><p>Make a note of that.</p><h3 id=delete-the-instance-keep-the-boot-volume>Delete the instance, keep the boot volume<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#delete-the-instance-keep-the-boot-volume>#</a></h3><p>Find your instance that will no longer start and terminate it <strong>MAKING

NOT CHECKED</strong></p><p><img loading=lazy src=1665508229.png alt="Do NOT check to delete the boot volume. NOT. NOPE NOPE
NOT."></p><p>OK, now we basically just recreate it with the same boot disk and we're
good. All that will change is the IP we access it at. Not great, but
good enough for free. 🤷</p><h3 id=create-the-instance-with-that-boot-volume>Create the instance with that boot volume<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#create-the-instance-with-that-boot-volume>#</a></h3><p>We follow the instructions from the top with a twist: Rather than set up
the whole thing again, we set the Availability Domain of the new
instance to match the just-terminated one, and we set the Image to use
the previous Boot Volume.</p><p>So on to "Create Instance":
<a href=https://cloud.oracle.com/compute/instances/create>https://cloud.oracle.com/compute/instances/create</a></p><p>1) Hit "Edit" in the Placement panel and select the Availability
Domain to the one you noted earlier (if needed)</p><p><img loading=lazy src=1665508654.png alt></p><p>2) Image And Shape -> Edit -> Change image</p><p><img loading=lazy src=1665508763.png alt></p><p>3) In the "Image Source" dropdown, select "Boot volumes"</p><p><img loading=lazy src=1665508835.png alt></p><p>Your list should show your existing boot volume.</p><p>Select it, click "Select Image"</p><p>4) Select your desired "Shape" features as before - Ampere, 2x oCPUs,
12GB RAM</p><p>5) Click Create and see your instance spin up</p><p>Note: The server instance's public IP <strong>will change</strong>. Adapt your <code>ssh</code> command when connecting to the server.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://d13.co/benchmarking-algorand-amm-real-user-swap-performance/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Benchmarking Algorand AMM 1:1 real world swap performance</span>
